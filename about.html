      Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines
      native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate,
      culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially
      and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

      Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism
      and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.Historical events such as
      invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
      introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the
      New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number
      of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have
      become staples in many regions of India.

      Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the
      spice trade between India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's
      Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe
      and Asia. Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world,
      especially those from Europe (especially Britain), the Middle East,
      Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius,
      Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.
