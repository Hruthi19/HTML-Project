      <p>
        Kashmiri cuisine is the cuisine of the Kashmir Valley in the Indian
        subcontinent. Rice is the staple food of Kashmiris and has been so since
        ancient times. Vegetable curries and meat, along with rice, are the most
        popular food items in Kashmir. Vegetable curries and meat along with
        rice, some vegetables and salad are prepared on special occasions like
        Eid only. Kashmiris consume meat voraciously.Despite being Brahmin, most
        Kashmiri Hindus are meat eaters

      <p>
        The food of Punjab is meant for the strong-hearted. It is rich in
        flavours and has a liberal dose of ghee (clarified butter) and spices.
        Punjab has an abundance of milk and therefore milk products are an
        important part of daily diet. No meal is complete without large
        glassfuls of butter milk or lassi (yoghurt drink). The people of this
        region are largely wheat eaters and have developed variations of breads
        including the stuffed a/oo paralha (potato bread) and the makke ki roti
        (maize bread). Vegetarian delights such as sarson saag (mustard leaf
        curry), rajma-chawal (kidney beans with steamed rice) and kadhi (gram
        flour and yoghurt curry) are the most popular Punjabi dishes. Punjabis
        have also created a combination of the northwest frontier cuisine and
        Mughlai recipes to present rich poultry and mutton dishes. The
        ubiquitous "tandoori chicken" s a great favorite!

        The cuisine of Uttar Pradesh is just as diverse as its geography.
        Ranging from simple every day fare to rich, elaborate banquets, the
        cuisine of Uttar Pradesh has absorbed and adapted a variety of cuisines
        to create an entire smorgasbord of wonderful dishes. The people of Uttar
        Pradesh love to cook, to eat and to feed! Difference in communities
        notwithstanding, as a people, they are very warm and hospitable. For
        most of them, the ultimate in hospitality means you feed your guests
        till they beg for mercy. Many Hindu communities are staunch vegetarians
        and they have created a vast variety of vegetarian dishes ranging from
        the all time favorite puri-aloo (potatoes and fried wheat bread) to
        savouries and divine desserts and sweetmeats.

        In the desert areas of Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Barmer the scarcity of
        water and fresh green vegetables had- its impact on the creativity of
        the cooks. Instead of water, the womenfolk of the herdsmen used milk,
        buttermilk and clarified butter that was available in plenty, as well as
        dried lentils and beans from native plants. Gram flour is a major
        ingredient and is used for preparing delicacies like gatta ki sabzi,
        pakodi and khata. Bajra and corn, the staple grains, go to making rotis,
        rabdi and kheechdi. And various chutneys prepared from locally available
        spices like coriander, garlic, mint and turmeric round off the regional
        flavor.

        Almost always strictly vegetarian, Gujarati cuisine is unlike any other
        Indian cuisine. The difference lies in the unusual blending of the sweet
        with the savoury into a harmonious whole. Even though the state of
        Gujarat has absorbed many outside influences down the ages, the cuisine
        has remained much the same. The grand spread of Gujarati cuisine can be
        glimpsed and savoured in the very popular "Gujarati Thali" a large
        silver platter consisting of innumerable bowls full of vegetable
        curries, dais or lentil based gravies, a variety of breads, savories -
        crispy fried farsans. Sweetmeats and an amazing range of sweet and sour
        chutneys and pickles. The entire meal including the vegetables and dais
        (curried lentils) achieves a delicate balance of flavours - sweet and
        sour, salty and spicy, crisp and soft, low fat and deep-fried!

        Bengali food consists of a lot of fish, lentils and rice. Breakfast
        could be milk and rice flakes eaten with gur (jaggery) or luchi (fluffy
        wheat pancake) with aloo dum (a dry spicy potato dish not to be mistaken
        for the Kashmiri dum a/oo). Lunch and dinner are elaborate affairs. The
        first course is rice and daal (lentil curry) with vegetables, pickled
        mangoes and fresh salad. It is followed by rice and meat and yet another
        course of rice and-fish: Great fish eaters, the true blue Bengali is the
        one who can crunch fish bones without letting them stick in the throat!
        The "hilsa" fish is a specialty when cooked in mustard sauce

        aromatic meat and rice preparation called biryani belongs to Hyderabad.
        Taking its cue from the Nizams of Hyderabad, this distinctly Muslim food
        is mainly concerned with succulent meats, sweet spices and ways of
        putting them together in the most delectable fashion there could be.
        Fruits, like custard apples, bananas, mangoes and the locally grown
        grape, anab e shahi, act like an antidote to the spices of the food.

        Rice is the staple of the Kerala diet Various preparations form the base
        of the meal; curries of fish, meat and vegetable accompany it Most
        dishes bear the flavor of coconut, curry leaves and mustard seeds, and
        the tastes of coconut milk and tamarind. All communities except the
        Namboodiris. a community of orthodox Brahmins, consume meat. Kerala
        cuisine is distinguished by its regional and religious variations The
        food of the Malabar Coast is distinct in its use of red chillies,
        pepper, mutton and beef preparations and the fondness for the famed
        Malabari "barolha" a many-layered fried bread made from unleavened
        dough.
